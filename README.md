#Inspiration

Journalingo was born from a simple observation: while there are many apps for tracking physical health, there are fewer options for consistently tracking and understanding emotional well-being. Our team wanted to create a tool that not only helps individuals reflect on their daily emotional journey but also provides insights and actionable feedback. We were inspired by the idea of combining technology with mental wellness, making emotional health tracking as routine and informative as physical health tracking.

#What it does

Journalingo is an emotional analysis journal that provides users with a unique way to track their emotional well-being. Users share their daily experiences through video entries. The app analyzes these videos to gauge emotional states, highlighting patterns and offering personalized insights. Users receive a daily PDF report summarizing their emotional analysis, along with suggestions for improvement. Journalingo stands out by offering a more interactive and intuitive approach to emotional journaling.

#How we built it

We built Journalingo using Flask framework, HTML, JS, CSS and various Bootstrap classes. The emotional analysis is powered by an OpenAI's GPT 4 & Whispr and Hugging face API, that processes video entries using facial recognition technologies. We utilized cloud services like Google Cloud and MongoDB for storing videos and generating PDF reports for working with . The development process involved iterative testing to refine the user interface and the accuracy of our emotional analysis.

#Challenges we ran into

One of our biggest challenges was ensuring the accuracy of the emotional analysis. We also faced difficulties in creating a user-friendly interface that can handle video uploads and generate reports seamlessly. Balancing between technical sophistication and ease of use was a constant theme throughout our development process.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're particularly proud of developing a robust emotional analysis algorithm that accurately interprets nuanced emotional expressions. We're also proud of our sleek, user-friendly interface that encourages daily interaction. Above all, receiving positive feedback from our initial user tests has been incredibly rewarding, affirming the potential impact of Journalingo on emotional well-being.

#What we learned

This project has been a fantastic learning journey. We've gained deeper insights into emotional intelligence algorithms, improved our skills in full-stack development, and learned about the importance of user-centered design. We've also learned valuable lessons in teamwork and project management, especially in a hackathon setting.

#What's next for Journalingo

Looking ahead, we plan to incorporate machine learning to enhance our emotional analysis further. We're also exploring partnerships with mental health professionals to provide users with more comprehensive support. Long-term, we aim to integrate Journalingo with wearable technology for more holistic health tracking. Our vision is to make Journalingo a go-to tool for anyone looking to improve their emotional intelligence and mental well-being.
